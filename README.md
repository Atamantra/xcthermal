A Flask-powered weather engine for pilots who need to know where the lift is. It grabs complex data from Open-Meteo and Meteoblue, crunches it into fast binary files, and renders clean charts so you can spend less time looking at your phone and more time in the core. Built to work fast, even on a mountain launch with one bar of signal.
